# Programmers Online Resume Template
## INTRO
This is a Responsive Resume template for programmers. It is developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
## So what is Jekyll all about?
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) and our [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages](pages.github.com), which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.
